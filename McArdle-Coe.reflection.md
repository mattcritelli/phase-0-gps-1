What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I had some issues remembering some of the commands but after suing them so many times they stuck in my memory better and made the process go faster.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The fit fetch command that i had only seen in solo reseaerch was explained and i feel i have a better understanding.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
On questions i asked was about a few keyboard shortcut different the different command prompts had and we exchanged some tips.
What still confuses you about Git?
I do no fully understand some of the command i have read about and expect with application and more practice they will become clearer.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was nice to be able to troubleshoot with another person and the guide was nice as he helped us in a direction rather than giving us an answer. This helped my thought processing
